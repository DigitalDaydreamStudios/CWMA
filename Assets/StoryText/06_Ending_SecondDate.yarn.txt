<<StartTalking Player>> I really enjoyed that, in spite of all the awkwardness!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Actually, me too!

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe first dates are supposed to be like that.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Like what?

<<StartTalking Player>> Full of awkward moments.  We’re both dealing with the anxiety and the promise of something new.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah, it’s a little terrifying but I’m glad we did it.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, me too!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Maybe we could have a second first date in a week?

<<StartTalking Player>> That might be a good idea, and there's less pressure.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah, It couldn't get much worse.
