<<StartTalking Player>> Well.. that was a bit awkward, but I enjoyed getting to know you

<<StartTalking Gina>> Same here, We survived our first date.

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe first dates are supposed to be like that.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Like what?

<<StartTalking Player>> Full of awkward moments.  We’re both dealing with the anxiety and the promise of something new.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, it’s a little terrifying but I’m glad we did it.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, me too!

<<StartTalking Gina>> Maybe we could have a second first date in a week?

<<StartTalking Player>> That might be a good idea, and there's less pressure.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, It couldn't get much worse.
