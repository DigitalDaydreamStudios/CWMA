<<StartTalking Jordy>> So weird how that last guy forgot to tip.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I was sure he'd remember after all the shortcuts we took.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Sure, we got there 20 minutes late.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> But seeing the city is why people take ride shares, 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Right?
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I even setup the back seat with air freshers and lotion.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Who doesn't love soft skin?

<<PlayerEnters Characters>>

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Who doesn't love lotion!?

<<StartTalking Player>> Umm.. Jordy, right?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Hey there!
<<StartTalking Jordy>> The almighty app says you've got two stop?

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep, an apartment a few blocks away then the movie theater.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And it's a Friday Night!
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I'm guessing you've got a date?

<<TriggerEvent EventManager Car_go>>

<<StartTalking Player>> Correct again.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Wants some tips?  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> They're guaranteed to get you to date Number Two!

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks, but I think I've got---

<<StartTalking Jordy>> First, Be yourself.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Well, unless you're a terrible person.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Then you've got other problems.

<<StartTalking Player>> Uh Huh, oh looks like our turn is coming--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> But you seem cool,
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I'm a pretty good judge of character.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks, umm the GPS says--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Second, listen more than you talk.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Dates are conversations, not a chance for a TED talk.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh I think we missed--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Third, Don't give advice unless it's requested.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, not sure it's legal to make a turn here--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Finally, silence is better than saying something dumb.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Anyway, it works for me.

<<StartTalking Player>> GREAT! THANKS! I'll keep that in mind.

<<TriggerEvent EventManager Car_stop>>

<<StartTalking Jordy>> AND... We're here.

<<PlayFX AudioManager car_door>>
<<GinaEnters Characters>>

<<StartTalking Player>> Hi! Nice to meet in person.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Same here. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> I'm looking forward to tonight.

<<TriggerEvent EventManager Car_go>>

<<StartTalking Player>> Great, I hope I don't disappoint.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Well, I enjoyed chatting online.
<<StartTalking Gina>> And I'm looking forward to more of that. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> And seeing this movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> Same here.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> We were just talking about date night tips.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh?

<<StartTalking Player>> I'm sure you don't need to hear them, you're probably more experienced than me.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Uhh what...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> yikes.

<<StartTalking Player>> That's not what I meant.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> ..not that being experienced is bad, 
<<StartTalking Player>> I just assumed... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You forgot tip Number Three my guy.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Should have listened to the ride share guru.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Welcome back anxiety.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Just saying.
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> What's that saying about assuming things?
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> It makes an as--

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I just need to focus on fixing this.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Sure, solve now what months of therapy has failed to.

<<StartTalking Player>> Sorry... I'm a little nervous.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, ok..

<<Silent Player>> ...

<<Silent Gina>> ...
<<StartTalking Gina>> First dates are always a little awkward.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, and I might have had too many...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Well, I guess that's better than a lot of second dates that go nowhere.

<<StartTalking Player>> So.. um, how about this weather we're having?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah. We're.. having... weather.
<<StartTalking Gina>> ... Are you a bit nervous?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yes!

<<StartTalking Player>> I think she was asking m--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yeah, but driving makes me nervous.

<<StartTalking Gina>> But your job is driving?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yeah, but life is about facing fears, growing, and narrowly avoiding being sideswiped.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Sorta, like going on a date when it scares the crap out of you?

<<StartTalking Player>> Glad I'm not the only one.

<<StartTalking Player>> Sooo… 5 more minutes till the theater?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nope, 7 minutes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Huh?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Missed another turn... or two.  

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Well, this is an awkward ride. 
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> But first dates are supposed to be sorta awkward.
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Right?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Just play it cool.
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I appreciate the vote of confidence!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Look on the bright side. 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You’ve made a wonderful new friend.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Jordy, the oversharing, turn missing, Ride share guy...  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Another great first date thanks to the gig economy. 

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I can salvageable this, I think... what do I do?

<<StartTalking Player>> It's all good.
<<StartTalking Player>> The first few minutes are previews anyway.  
<<StartTalking Player>> Let it Ride.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I like watching previews.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> What are y'all seeing?

<<StartTalking Player>> That new rom-com.

<<StartTalking Gina>> The one with the actress from that one sitcom.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> The one with a bunch of people in their late 20s living in that huge apartment.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, in San Francisco... how can they afford that?

<<StartTalking Player>> That's the real mystery.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Crimes. They must be doing crimes. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Oh, I saw the trailer.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

<<StartTalking Player>> Critics think every movie is bad.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great, we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> 2 hours and 45 minutes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Why did you pick this movie again?

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?  

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And We’re Here! 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I hope that you are in the 30 percent of people with incorrect err… ‘unique’ opinions!

<<setscene Dryve>>
<<StartTalking Player>> Hey, I've got a joke!

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great!  We still have 6 minutes left to kill. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Probably closer to 5.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Just ran that red light. 

<<StartTalking Player>> Anyway… I tried to be a Dryver driver once. 
<<StartTalking Player>> Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

<<Silent Gina>> ...

<<Silent Player>> ...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Hey man, Why are making fun of my work? 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I love my job.
		
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think he was just making a bad joke... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I get to pick my own hours, sure I don't get reimburshed for repairs or health insurance--

<<StartTalking Player>> Or get paid leave--

<<StartTalking Gina>> Or qualify for unemployment--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I know that, but I like the freedom.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> You think that's a joke?

<<StartTalking Player>> No.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> yes…. 
<<StartTalking Player>> How do I answer that?

<<StartTalking Gina>> From a labor perspective it exploits workers and regresses traditional taxi benefits, 
<<StartTalking Gina>> all while concentrating capital towards rich tech bros and their richer investors.
<<StartTalking Gina>> But this town has no taxi services.. in part because the gig economy killed them.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You're not wrong, 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> But I used to work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> This isn't great, but it's better.  

<<StartTalking Gina>> Fair.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And, I’m my own boss. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nobody tells me what to do.

<<StartTalking Player>> Turn left here!

<<Silent Gina>> ...

<<Silent Player>> ...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Get out...

<<StartTalking Player>> Yes

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Dude.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Not cool.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Ok… 

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Oh my god, why was that an option?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I wasn’t serious, Why did you pick that option? 

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I’m an idiot.

<<StartTalking Player>> It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning.

<<StartTalking Gina>> If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oops, sorry.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

<<StartTalking Gina>> Could you not!!!!

<<StartTalking Jordy>> … ARRIVES at their destination on time!  Give or take a few minutes.

<<StartTalking Player>> How was your day?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Okay, could have been better.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh ok…

<<Silent Gina>> …

<<Silent Player>> ... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Did something crappy happen?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah sorta, over the past few weeks my pens kept disappearing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Like a pen thief?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and bought my own pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> That sucks, do you know who did it?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah,
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> But how do you ask your coworker that?

<<StartTalking Player>> Right, that’s would be awkward.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Should I give some advice.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, you’ve got SO much experience with confronting thieves.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I feel like I should say something, to show I care?

<<StartTalking Player>> You should sneak in at night and search everyone’s desks.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah that sounds like…

<<StartTalking Jordy>> A terrible idea.

<<StartTalking Gina>> A great idea.

<<StartTalking Player>> Well, I’m glad to help--

<<StartTalking Gina>> If the janitors or any of my late shift coworkers are there, 
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this--

<<StartTalking Gina>> Who wouldn't break into their place of employement to solve the mystery of the gel pen thief?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You’d be justified with gel pens.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Right!  
<<StartTalking Gina>> Thinking about saving my pens made me feel a lot better.

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem.
