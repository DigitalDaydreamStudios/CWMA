And that’s how I discovered where the cold sore came from.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>>
I have no idea how that came up?  
<<StartTalking Jordy>>
Sorry, I talk a lot when I’m driving.

Sooo… 5 more minutes till the theater?

<<StartTalking Jordy>>
Nope, 7 minutes.
<<StartTalking Jordy>>
Missed another turn... or two.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>>
Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Well, this is an awkward ride. 
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> But first dates are supposed to be sorta awkward.
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Right?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Just play it cool, 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Think about it, you haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> yet.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Oh, what a confidence boost!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Look on the bright side, 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Jordy, the oversharing, turn missing, Ride share guy...  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Another great first date thanks to the gig economy. 

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> This is salvageable, I think... what do I do?

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem, the first few minutes of the movie are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Aww, I like watching previews

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I heard they were showing a trailer for the big superhero flick before your movie.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Honestly, that trailer is probably better than what you’re seeing.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

<<StartTalking Player>> Critics think every movie is bad.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great (Need a good eye roll animation), we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> 2 hours and 45 minutes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Why did you pick this movie again?

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?  

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And We’re Here! 
I hope that you are in the 30 percent of people with incorrect err… ‘unique’ opinions!

<<StartTalking Player>> Hey, I've got a joke!

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great!  We still have 6 minutes left to kill. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Probably closer to 5 (new window) Just ran that red light. (both characters get Wtf looks)

<<StartTalking Player>> Anyway… (typed out slowly) I tried to be a Dryver driver once. 
Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 


<<set $speaker to "Gina">> ...

<<StartTalking Player>> ...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I love my job.
		
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think he was just making a bad joke... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> So the gig economy is a joke?

<<StartTalking Player>> No.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> yes…. 
<<StartTalking Player>> How do I answer that?


<<StartTalking Gina>> From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

<<StartTalking Player>> I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That’s obvious.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s respectable.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Plus, I’m my own boss. 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nobody tells me what to do.


<<StartTalking Player>> Turn left here

(Awkward back and forth stare down between Jordy and Player)

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Get out...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Ummm, are you trying to open the door while we’re in a moving car?

<<StartTalking Player>> No…
<<StartTalking Player>> Yes

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Dude.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Not cool.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Ok… 

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Oh my god, why was that an option?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I wasn’t serious, Why did you pick that option? 

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I’m an idiot.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, you are!

<<StartTalking Player>> It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the damn movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning

<<StartTalking Gina>> If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement

<<StartTalking Player>> Oops, sorry

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

<<StartTalking Gina>> Could you not!!!!

<<StartTalking Jordy>> … Arrives at their destination on time!  We’re here!

<<StartTalking Player>> How was your day?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Okay, could have been better.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh ok…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> ... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Did something crappy happen?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah Sorta, over the past few weeks my pens keep going missing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Like a pen thief?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> That sucks, do you know who did it?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah maybe, but how do you ask your coworker that?

<<StartTalking Player>> Right, that’s a struggle.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Should I give some advice.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, you’ve got experience with office supply theft.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I feel like I should say something to show that I care?

<<StartTalking Player>> That sounds rough, but I believe in your ability to handle it.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Thanks… I think I just needed someone to listen to me rant a bit

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, Well I’m glad to help

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’ll figure out a way to handle it Monday morning

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!

<<setscene Dryve>>
<<StartTalking Player>> You should sneak in at night and search everyone’s desks

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah that sounds like…

<<StartTalking Jordy>> A terrible idea

<<StartTalking Gina>> A great idea

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, Well I’m glad to help..

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’ll be the crazy person sneaking into my office to look through desks for my pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, I see your point...

<<StartTalking Gina>> If the janitors or any of my late working coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh, You were joking about Breaking and Entering at my place of employment to get my $10 pack of gel pens?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You’d be justified with Gel pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> How far are we from...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!
