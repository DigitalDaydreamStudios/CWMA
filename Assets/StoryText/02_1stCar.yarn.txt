<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And that’s how I discovered where the cold sore came from.  
I have no idea how that came up?  
Sorry, I talk a lot when I’m driving.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> …

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> ...

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Sooo… 5 more minutes till the theater?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Nope, 7 minutes.
Missed another turn... or two.  
Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Well, this is an awkward ride. 
But first dates are supposed to be sorta awkward.
Right?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Just play it cool, 
maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  
Think about it, you haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself
yet.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Oh, what a confidence boost!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Look on the bright side, 
you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  
Jordy, the oversharing, turn missing, Ride share guy...  
Another great first date thanks to the gig economy. 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> This is salvageable, I think... what do I do?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> No problem, the first few minutes of the movie are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Aww, I like watching previews

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> I heard they were showing a trailer for the big superhero flick before your movie.  
Honestly, that trailer is probably better than what you’re seeing.  
Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Critics think every movie is bad.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Great (Need a good eye roll animation), we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> 2 hours and 45 minutes.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Why did you pick this movie again?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?  

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And We’re Here! 
I hope that you are in the 30 percent of people with incorrect err… ‘unique’ opinions!

<<setscene Dryve>>
<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Hey, I've got a joke!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Great!  We still have 6 minutes left to kill. 

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Probably closer to 5 (new window) Just ran that red light. (both characters get Wtf looks)

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Anyway… (typed out slowly) I tried to be a Dryver driver once. 
Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> ...

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> ...

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. 
I love my job.
		
<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I think he was just making a bad joke... 

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> So the gig economy is a joke?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> No.. yes…. How do I answer that?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> That’s obvious.  
I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> That’s respectable.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Plus, I’m my own boss. 
Nobody tells me what to do.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Turn left here

(Awkward back and forth stare down between Jordy and Player)

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Get out...

<<setscene Dryve>>
<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> *Tries to unlock door*

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Ummm, are you trying to open the door while we’re in a moving car?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> No… (New window) Yes

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Dude.  Not cool.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Ok… 

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Oh my god, why was that an option?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> I wasn’t serious, Why did you pick that option? 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> I’m an idiot.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Yeah, you are!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the damn movie.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oops, sorry

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Could you not!!!!

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> … Arrives at their destination on time!  We’re here!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> How was your day?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Okay, could have been better.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh ok…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> ... 

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Did something crappy happen?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah Sorta, over the past few weeks my pens keep going missing.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Like a pen thief?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> That sucks, do you know who did it?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah maybe, but how do you ask your coworker that?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Right, that’s a struggle.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Should I give some advice.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Yeah, you’ve got experience with office supply theft.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> I feel like I should say something to show that I care?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> That sounds rough, but I believe in your ability to handle it.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Thanks… I think I just needed someone to listen to me rant a bit

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh, Well I’m glad to help

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I’ll figure out a way to handle it Monday morning

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> You should sneak in at night and search everyone’s desks

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah that sounds like…

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> A terrible idea

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> A great idea

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh, Well I’m glad to help..

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I’ll be the crazy person sneaking into my office to look through desks for my pens.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Yeah, I see your point...

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> If the janitors or any of my late working coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this...

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh, You were joking about Breaking and Entering at my place of employment to get my $10 pack of gel pens?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> You’d be justified with Gel pens.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> How far are we from...

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!
