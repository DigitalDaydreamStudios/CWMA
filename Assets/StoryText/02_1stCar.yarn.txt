<<setscene Dryve>>
<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> It's so weird how that last guy forgot to tip.
I was sure he'd remember after all the shortcuts I took.
Sure we arrived 20 minutes later,
But seeing the city is why people take ride shares, 
Right?
I even setup the back seat with air freshers and lotion.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Jordy, right?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Yep, buckle up.
The almighty App says you've got two stop?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Yep, an apartment a few blocks away and the theater.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Friday Night,
Apartment and then a movie... 
I'm guessing you've got a date?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> You guessed right.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Wants some tips? Guaranteed to get you to the second date.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh, that's ok--

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Be yourself,
Well, unless you're a terrible person.
Then you've got other things to work on.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> ... Helpful.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> But you seem cool,
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh, Thanks man. I appreciate--

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> But seriously, listen more than you talk.
Don't give advice unless it's requested.
And silence is better than saying something shitty.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I'll keep that in mind.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Stop Two!!! We're here.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Hey there, nice to meet you in person.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Nice to meet you too. 
I'm looking forward to tonight.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Great, I hope I don't disappoint.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Well, I enjoyed chatting online.
And I'm looking forward to more of that. 
And seeing this movie.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Same here.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> We were just talking about date night tips.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I'm sure you don't need to hear them, you're probably more experienced than me.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Uhh what...

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Yikes.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> That's not what I meant, 
not that being experienced is bad, 
I just assumed, 
umm..

Honest question, are you a bit nervous?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Yes

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I think she was asking me...

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> I know, it's just driving makes me nervous.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> But your job is driving?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Yeah, but life is about facing fears and growing.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Like going on a date when it scares the crap out of you?

Missed another turn... or two.

Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Well, this is an awkward ride. 
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> But first dates are supposed to be sorta awkward.
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Right?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Just play it cool. 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> yet.
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Oh, what a confidence boost!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Look on the bright side, 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Jordy, the oversharing, turn missing, Ride share guy...  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Another great first date thanks to the gig economy. 

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> This is salvageable, I think... what do I do?

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem, the first few minutes of the movie are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Aww, I like watching previews.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Which movie are you seeing?

<<StartTalking Player>> That new rom-com.

<<StartTalking Gina>> The one with the actress from Friends.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Oh, I saw the trailer.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

<<StartTalking Player>> Critics think every movie is bad.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

//Gina rolls her eyes
<<StartTalking Gina>> Great, we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> 2 hours and 45 minutes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Why did you pick this movie again?

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?  

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And We’re Here! 
I hope that you are in the 30 percent of people with incorrect err… ‘unique’ opinions!

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great!  We still have 6 minutes left to kill. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Probably closer to 5.
Just ran that red light.

<<StartTalking Player>> Anyway… I tried to be a Dryver driver once. 
Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> ...

<<StartTalking Player>> ...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I love my job.
		
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think he was just making a bad joke... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> So the gig economy is a joke?

<<StartTalking Player>> No.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> yes…. 
<<StartTalking Player>> How do I answer that?

<<StartTalking Gina>> From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s respectable.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Plus, I’m my own boss. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nobody tells me what to do.

<<StartTalking Player>> Turn left here!

<<StartTalking Player>> It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the damn movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning.

<<StartTalking Gina>> If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oops, sorry.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> ... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Did something crappy happen?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah Sorta, over the past few weeks my pens keep going missing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Like a pen thief?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  
It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> That sucks, do you know who did it?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah,
I think. 
But how do you ask your coworker that?

<<StartTalking Player>> Right, that’s a struggle.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Should I give some advice.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, you’ve got experience with office supply theft.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I feel like I should say something, to show I care?

<<StartTalking Player>> Well, I’m glad to help--

<<StartTalking Gina>> If the janitors or any of my late shift coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this--

<<StartTalking Gina>> Who wouldn't break into their place of employement to solve the mystery of the gel pen thief?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You’d be justified with Gel pens.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Thanks.  Thinking about saving my pens made me feel a lot better.

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem.
