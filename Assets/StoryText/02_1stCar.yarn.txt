<<StartTalking Jordy>> It's so weird how that last guy forgot to tip.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I was sure he'd remember after all the shortcuts I took.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Sure we arrived 20 minutes later,
<<StartTalking Jordy>> But seeing the city is why people take ride shares, 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Right?
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I even setup the back seat with air freshers and lotion.

<<StartTalking Player>> Jordy, right?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yep, buckle up.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> The almighty App says you've got two stop?

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep, an apartment a few blocks away and the theater.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Friday Night,
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Apartment and then a movie... 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I'm guessing you've got a date?

<<TriggerEvent EventManager Car_go>>

<<StartTalking Player>> You guessed right.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Wants some tips? Guaranteed to get you to the second date.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, that's ok--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Be yourself,
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Well, unless you're a terrible person.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Then you've got other things to work on.

<<StartTalking Player>> ... Helpful.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> But you seem cool,
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I'm a pretty good judge of character.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, Thanks man. I appreciate--

<<StartTalking Jordy>> But seriously, listen more than you talk.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Don't give advice unless it's requested.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> And silence is better than saying something shitty.

<<StartTalking Player>> I'll keep that in mind.

<<StartTalking Player>> Great, I hope I don't disappoint.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Well, I enjoyed chatting online.
<<StartTalking Gina>> And I'm looking forward to more of that. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> And seeing this movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> Same here.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> We were just talking about date night tips.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh?

<<StartTalking Player>> I'm sure you don't need to hear them, you're probably more experienced than me.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Uhh what...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yikes.

<<StartTalking Player>> That's not what I meant, 
<<StartTalking Player>> not that being experienced is bad, 
<<StartTalking Player>> I just assumed,

<<StartTalking Gina>> I guess first dates are always a little awkward.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep, and I might have had too many...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yes

<<StartTalking Player>> I think she was asking me...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I know, it's just driving makes me nervous.

<<StartTalking Gina>> But your job is driving?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Yeah, but life is about facing fears and growing.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Like going on a date when it scares the crap out of you?

<<StartTalking Jordy>>
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Well, this is an awkward ride. 
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> But first dates are supposed to be sorta awkward.
<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Right?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Just play it cool. 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Oh, what a confidence boost!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Look on the bright side, 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Jordy, the oversharing, turn missing, Ride share guy...

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem, the first few minutes of the movie are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Aww, I like watching previews.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Which movie are you seeing?

<<StartTalking Player>> That new rom-com.

<<StartTalking Gina>> The one with the actress from Friends.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Oh, I saw the trailer.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

<<StartTalking Player>> Critics think every movie is bad.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

//Gina rolls her eyes
<<StartTalking Gina>> Great, we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> 2 hours and 45 minutes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Why did you pick this movie again?

<<StartTalking Player>> Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Just ran that red light.

<<StartTalking Player>> Anyway… I tried to be a Dryver driver once. 
<<StartTalking Player>> Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> ...

<<StartTalking Player>> ...

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> I love my job.
		
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think he was just making a bad joke... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> So the gig economy is a joke?

<<StartTalking Player>> No.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> yes…. 
<<StartTalking Player>> How do I answer that?

<<StartTalking Gina>> From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s respectable.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Plus, I’m my own boss. 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Nobody tells me what to do.

<<StartTalking Player>> Turn left here!

<<StartTalking Player>> It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the damn movie.

<<StartTalking Player>> I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning.

<<StartTalking Gina>> If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oops, sorry.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

<<StartTalking Gina>> Okay, could have been better.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh ok…

<<StartTalking Gina>> …

<<StartTalking Player>> ... 

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Did something crappy happen?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah Sorta, over the past few weeks my pens keep going missing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Like a pen thief?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

<<StartTalking Player>> That sucks, do you know who did it?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah,
<<StartTalking Gina>> I think. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> But how do you ask your coworker that?

<<StartTalking Player>> Right, that’s a struggle.

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> Should I give some advice.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, you’ve got experience with office supply theft.

<<ChangeExpression PlayersBrain Talking>> I feel like I should say something, to show I care?

<<StartTalking Gina>> A great idea.

<<StartTalking Player>> Well, I’m glad to help--

<<StartTalking Gina>> If the janitors or any of my late shift coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this--

<<StartTalking Gina>> Who wouldn't break into their place of employement to solve the mystery of the gel pen thief?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> You’d be justified with Gel pens.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Thanks.  Thinking about saving my pens made me feel a lot better.

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem.
