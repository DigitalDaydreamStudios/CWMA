<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Well here we are again

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Crazy the Dryve app put y’all in my car again.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah… (Slow)

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Crazy (Slow)

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Must be the universe saying “This is a great driver!!!”  Btw remember to rate, I noticed I didn’t get any feedback on the last one.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> We were running late

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Hey, I’ve got this awesome story…

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> This is just great

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I have to change the subject.
Gotta turn this back into a date instead of story time with the Jordy.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> All the pressure is on you.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Ok I can do this…

<<StartTalking Player>> Let’s hear the story.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Really?

<<StartTalking Player>> He seems excited about it

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Great, so after I dropped you off I realized something.  I forgot that you two were on a date!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> You realized that after you…

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Guess I was so distracted earlier… Oops I just missed another turn.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh my god.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Anyway, I decided I need to do something nice since I talked so much during your date.  So I ran to the store, grabbed some chocolates and a tall boy.  Then I turned down all the other ride request until you two got out of the movie. That way I could apologize for earlier.

<<StartTalking Player>> Wow, that’s actually really nice.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah, thank you.

<<StartTalking Player>> Definitely getting 5 stars!

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> No problem, now I’ll shut up and leave you to the rest of your date.  Because we’re here!!

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks man!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Above and beyond the call of duty.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> No problem.  G’ Night!

<<StartTalking Player>> Hey, can you tell me about your day

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Me?

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Um you asked that already

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Wow, you seriously asked that again.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I forgot… And now I feel like an idiot..

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> I’m sure you can save this.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Really?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> No. You are still an idiot.

<<StartTalking Player>> What did you think of the movie.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> It was ok.

<<StartTalking Player>> Really? 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> What did you think?

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Here’s your chance to relate.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Great, but how should I respond?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> You have two choices. Do you want to be like a parrot and repeat what she said? 
Or do you want to form your own opinion and give an honest, well thought out answer?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I feel like there should be more choices.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Nope.  Only two possibilities.  In existence.  Two choices.  Pick One.

<<setscene Dryve>>
<<StartTalking Player>> I liked it. I don’t know why the critics rated it so low. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I can see why the movie got rated in the 30s.

<<StartTalking Player>> But I thought you liked it.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> The movie was far from perfect, but I still enjoyed it.

<<StartTalking Player>> I think the critics were still wrong.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Everyone is entitled to their opinion, whether you agree or not. 
Not everything has to be made for everyone.

<<StartTalking Player>> …

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Wise words. (delay) Also, We’re here!

<<StartTalking Player>> The critics were right, I don’t know how that terrible movie got made.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh, ok.  What didn’t you like about it?

<<StartTalking Player>> Umm.. The pacing was off.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Ok, in what act did you think it fell apart?

<<StartTalking Player>> I mean it was all off paced.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Cool.

<<StartTalking Player>> …

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> …

<<StartTalking Player>> It’s cool that you liked it though

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Is it cool that I liked it?  You said, and I quote “I don’t know how that terrible movie was made.”

<<setscene innerDate>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Great now you’ve screwed yourself

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> No, I can find a way out of this.

<<StartTalking Player>> I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.  It’s ok for different people to like different things.  Just because me and bunch of other people hated something that doesn’t mean you have to too.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Thanks for apologizing.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And we’re here!  Hope you two have a good night.

<<StartTalking Player>> Hopefully we both enjoy dinner.

<<StartTalking Player>> The movie can both be trash AND I can have no idea how that movie could have been made.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Which was trash?  Are you saying that I like trash?

<<StartTalking Player>> No, I’m saying you like things that everyone thinks is trash.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Um… wow

<<StartTalking Player>> And that’s ok.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> … Look, I’m ok with us not liking the same things and having different opinions.  But I feel like you’re more focused on your opinions being right and legitimate, and everyone else’s being wrong and ‘trash.’

<<StartTalking Player>> That’s not what I meant.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Dude, You referenced Trash like 3 times in 4 sentences.

<<StartTalking Player>> Not helping.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I’m sure you’re a nice guy… no actually I’m not sure of that.  Dryver can you drop me off here, I’ll get another ride.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Sure.

<<StartTalking Player>> No, wait…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Have a nice life.

<<StartTalking Player>> I don’t really know.  There were things I liked and things I didn’t.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I respect that.  It feels like everyone needs to have an opinion on everything immediately.

<<StartTalking Player>> Words like mediocre or ‘just ok’ have such a negative connotation, but I feel like both sorta fit for what we just watched.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Some things in life are just mediocre, and that is ok.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> And we’re here!  Hope you two have a good night.

<<StartTalking Player>> Hopefully we both enjoy dinner.
