<<StartTalking Player>> Finally, we made it!

<<StartTalking Gi na>> We could have walked here faster.

<<StartTalking Player>> He found a way to speed through every light and miss every turn.

<<StartTalking Gina>> It takes skills to be that terrible.

<<StartTalking Player>> So...
Five Stars?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Haha, definitely.

<<StartTalking Emily>> What movie are you seeing?

<<StartTalking Player>> I bought tickets online.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Cool story... 
I still need to know the name of the movie to find the tickets.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Oh god… I forgot the name of the movie.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You what?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think it’s either 'Love in New York' or 'Brooklyn Hearts', or something like that.  How many date movies could there be?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Well that’s a 50% chance of looking like an idiot.

[[Umm 'Love in New York'|LoveInNewYork]]
[[I believe 'Brooklyn Hearts'|BrooklynHearts]]

<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Brooklyn Sleeps Alone Tonight!!!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… glad someone knew.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Saw you were struggling. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> These names are generic.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks for the save.

<<StartTalking Emily>> CARD!

<<StartTalking Player>> Huh… 

<<StartTalking Emily>> Give. Me. Your. Card. 
<<StartTalking Emily>> So I can pull up your ticket for the movie you already forgot the title to.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I have a bad memory! 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I won't let this woundingly sarcastic teen ruin my date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> No, 
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> But awkwardly going through your wallet because you don't know what card you used, will. 

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Wow, who’s side are you on?

//Handle case for other movie
<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was 'Brooklyn Hearts.'

<<StartTalking Gina>> That is definitely not the movie.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… 
<<StartTalking Emily>> You bought a ticket for a movie you can’t even remember the title for.  
<<StartTalking Emily>> Real art connoisseur.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I am pretty sure it is 'Brooklyn Sleeps Alone' tonight. 

<<StartTalking Player>> Right, Thanks for the save.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Let’s just get inside.

<<StartTalking Emily>> CARD

<<StartTalking Player>> Huh… 

<<StartTalking Emily>> Give. Me. Your. Card. 
<<StartTalking Emily>> So I can pull up your ticket for the movie you already forgot the title to.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Busted!

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I have a bad memory! 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I won't let this woundingly sarcastic teen ruin my date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> No,

<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was this one.

<<StartTalking Emily>> You think!  
<<StartTalking Emily>> How many cards do you have?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh my god, Just run the card.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Fine… Bingo.

<<StartTalking Player>> Great, I sorta just guessed.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Not! Try Again.

<<StartTalking Player>> Why are you like this?
 
<<StartTalking Gina>> We are definitely missing the beginning of this movie.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Okay, Genius. Let’s try this again

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Also, why are teenagers so scary and why do I feel I need their approval?
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I’m an adult!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> That's what adults do.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> What?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Tell themselves they're adults after teens drag them.

<<StartTalking Gina>> RUN THE CARD!!!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Jeez, I’m running it.
<<StartTalking Emily>> And it’s printing.

<<StartTalking Player>> I don’t know what card it was, I’m just going to buy a new ticket.

<<StartTalking Emily>> The theater is sold out.
<<StartTalking Emily>> It’s a Friday Night.
<<StartTalking Emily>> Y’all are late to this showing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Seriously?
<<StartTalking Player>> The previews are just starting, we aren’t that late.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Can you check again?

<<StartTalking Emily>> If I can handle getting to the bus stop 45 minutes early for the one bus with a ramp, 
<<StartTalking Emily>> y’all can think to call your Dryve a whole 5 minutes earlier.  
<<StartTalking Emily>> And I’ve already checked the occupancy count... Twice.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Can we just try the cards?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Ok, Genius, Let’s try this again
