<<StartTalking Player>> Finally.
<<StartTalking Player>> We made it!

<<StartTalking Gina>> Could have walked here faster.

<<StartTalking Player>> He found a way to speed through every light and miss every turn.

<<StartTalking Gina>> It takes skill to be that terrible.

<<StartTalking Player>> So...
<<StartTalking Player>> Five Stars?

<<StartTalking Gina>> But of course!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Movie Title?

<<StartTalking Player>> I bought tickets online.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Cool story... 
<<StartTalking Emily>> Still need the movie's name to find your tickets in our system.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Oh god… I forgot the name of the movie.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You what?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think it’s either 'Love in New York' or 'Brooklyn Hearts', something like that.  
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> How many date movies could there be?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> So you've got a 50% chance of looking like an idiot.
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Assuming either is even right.

[[Umm 'Love in New York'|LoveInNewYork]]
[[I believe 'Brooklyn Hearts'|BrooklynHearts]]

<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was...

<<StartTalking Gina>> 'Brooklyn Sleeps Alone Tonight.'

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… glad someone knew.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Saw you struggling. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> These names aren't great.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks for the save.

<<StartTalking Emily>> CARD!

<<StartTalking Player>> Huh…

<<StartTalking Emily>> Give. Me. Your. Card. So. I. Can. Print. Your. Ticket.
<<StartTalking Emily>> There are other people dying slowly in line behind you.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>
 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I won't let this woundingly shady teen ruin my date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I'm sure you remember which card you bought it with.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Uhh.. sure.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> So much confidence!

//Handle case for other movie
<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was 'Brooklyn Hearts.'

<<StartTalking Gina>> That is definitely not the movie.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… 
<<StartTalking Emily>> You bought a ticket for a movie and can’t remember it's name.  
<<StartTalking Emily>> Real connoisseur here.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I am pretty sure it is 'Brooklyn Sleeps Alone Tonight.' 

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, that's right.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Let’s just get inside.

<<StartTalking Emily>> CARD!

<<StartTalking Player>> Huh… 

<<StartTalking Emily>> Give. Me. Your. Card. 
<<StartTalking Emily>> The line forming behind you hasn't stopped growing.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Busted!

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I have a bad memory!
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I won't let this woundingly sarcastic teen ruin my date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> No,
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> But awkwardly going through your wallet because you don't know what card you used, will.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Who’s side are you on?

<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was this one.

<<StartTalking Emily>> You think!  
<<StartTalking Emily>> How many cards do you have?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh my god, just run the card.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Fine… Bingo.

<<StartTalking Player>> Great, I sorta just guessed.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Not! Try again.
<<StartTalking Emily>> Must be another high interest low reward card you haven't paid off.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Whoa

<<StartTalking Player>> Why are you like this?
 
<<StartTalking Gina>> We are definitely missing the beginning of this movie.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Okay, Genius. Let’s try this again.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Also, why are teenagers so scary and why do I feel I need their approval?
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I’m an adult!

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> That's what adults do.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> What?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Tell themselves they're adults after teens drag them.

<<StartTalking Player>> Let’s try this one.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Are you sure this time?

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep… I think.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Because if you aren’t you can pick...

<<StartTalking Gina>> What circle of hell are we stuck in.
<<StartTalking Gina>> RUN THE CARD!!!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Jeez, I’m running it.
<<StartTalking Emily>> And it’s printing.
<<StartTalking Emily>> Enjoy the 'show.'

<<StartTalking Player>> YES.
<<StartTalking Player>> And you’re not joking this time?

<<StartTalking Emily>> I don’t joke.

<<StartTalking Player>> But.. just a minute ago.

<<StartTalking Player>> So, I don’t remember what card it was...

<<StartTalking Emily>> You have THAT many cards.

<<StartTalking Player>> So.. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I’m just going to buy a new ticket.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Really?

<<StartTalking Emily>> Well, The theater is sold out.

<<StartTalking Gina>> You've got to be joking.

<<StartTalking Emily>> It’s a Friday Night.
<<StartTalking Emily>> And Yyall are VERY late.

<<StartTalking Player>> Seriously?
<<StartTalking Player>> The previews are just starting, we aren’t that late.

<<StartTalking Emily>> If I can handle getting to the bus stop 45 minutes early for the one bus with a ramp, 
<<StartTalking Emily>> y’all can think to call your Dryve a whole 5 minutes earlier.  
<<StartTalking Emily>> And I’ve already checked the occupancy count... Twice.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Can you just try your other cards?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Ok, Genius. Let’s try this again.
