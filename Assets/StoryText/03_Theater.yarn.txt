<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Finally, we made it!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I feel like we could have walked here faster.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> That driver found a way to speed through every light and miss nearly every turn.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I feel like it takes skills to be that terrible.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> So Five Stars?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Haha, definitely.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> What movie are you seeing?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I bought tickets online.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Ok.. I still need to know the name of the movie to find the tickets.

<<setscene brainRoomCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Oh god… I forgot the name of the movie.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> You what?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> I think it’s either Love in New York or Brooklyn Hearts, or something like that.  How many date movies could there be?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Well that’s a 50% chance of looking like an idiot.

[[Umm.  Love in New York|LoveInNewYork]]
[[I believe Brooklyn Hearts|BrooklynHearts]]

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I think it was...

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Brooklyn Sleeps Alone Tonight!!!

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Great… glad someone knew.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Saw you were struggling a bit, these names are a little generic.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Thanks for the save there.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> CARD

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Huh… 

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Give me the your card so I can pull up your ticket order for the movie you totally forgot the title to.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I think it was Movie Name.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> That is definitely not the movie.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Great… you bought a ticket for movie you can’t even remember the title for.  Real art connoisseurs.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I am pretty sure it is Brooklyn sleeps alone tonight. 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Right, Thanks for the save there.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Let’s just get inside.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> CARD

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Huh… 

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Give me the your card so I can pull up your ticket order for the movie you totally forgot the title to.

<<setscene brainRoomCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Busted!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> I have a bad memory! I won't let this woundingly sarcastic teen ruin my date.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> No, but being awkward and going through the 3 different cards in your wallet to find the one that you bought the ticket on will. 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Wow, who’s side are you on.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I think it was this one.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> You think!  How many credit cards do you have?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh my god, Just run the card.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Fine… Bingo

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Great, I sorta just guessed.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> Not! Try Again.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Why are you like this?
 
<<set $speaker to "Gina">> We are definitely missing the beginning of this movie.

<<setscene brainRoomCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Okay, Genius. Let’s try this again

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Also, why are teenagers so scary and why do I feel I need their approval?  I’m an adult!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I don’t know what card it was, I’m just going to buy a new ticket.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> The theater is sold out, it’s a Friday Night and y’all are late to this showing.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Seriously?  The previews are just starting, we aren’t that late.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Can you check again?  We aren’t that late.

<<set $speaker to "Emily">> If I can handle getting to the bus stop 45 minutes early for the one bus with a ramp, y’all can think to call your Dryve a whole 5 minutes earlier.  And I’ve already checked the occupancy count... twice.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Can we just try the cards?

<<setscene brainRoomCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Anxiety">> Ok, Genius, Let’s try this again
