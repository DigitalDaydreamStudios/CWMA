<<StartTalking Player>> Finally, we made it!

<<StartTalking Gina>> I feel like we could have walked here faster.

<<StartTalking Player>> That driver found a way to speed through every light and miss nearly every turn.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I feel like it takes skills to be that terrible.

<<StartTalking Player>> So Five Stars?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Haha, definitely.

<<StartTalking Emily>> What movie are you seeing?

<<StartTalking Player>> I bought tickets online.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Ok.. I still need to know the name of the movie to find the tickets.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Oh god… I forgot the name of the movie.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You what?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think it’s either Love in New York or Brooklyn Hearts, or something like that.  How many date movies could there be?

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Well that’s a 50% chance of looking like an idiot.

<<StartTalking Player>> I think it was...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Brooklyn Sleeps Alone Tonight!!!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… glad someone knew.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Saw you were struggling a bit, these names are a little generic.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks for the save there.

<<StartTalking Emily>> CARD

<<StartTalking Player>> Huh… 

<<StartTalking Emily>> Give me the your card so I can pull up your ticket order for the movie you totally forgot the title to.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I have a bad memory! I won't let this woundingly sarcastic teen ruin my date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> No, but being awkward and going through the 3 different cards in your wallet to find the one that you bought the ticket on will. 

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Wow, who’s side are you on?

<<StartTalking Emily>> Great… you bought a ticket for movie you can’t even remember the title for.  Real art connoisseurs.

<<StartTalking Emily>> You think!  How many credit cards do you have?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh my god, Just run the card.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Fine… Bingo

<<StartTalking Player>> Great, I sorta just guessed.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Not! Try Again.

<<StartTalking Player>> Why are you like this?
 
<<StartTalking Gina>> We are definitely missing the beginning of this movie.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Okay, Genius. Let’s try this again

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Also, why are teenagers so scary and why do I feel I need their approval?  I’m an adult!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Are you sure this time?

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep… I think.

<<StartTalking Emily>> Because if you aren’t you can pick...

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh my god, is this a circle of hell.  RUN THE CARD!!!

<<StartTalking Emily>> Jeez, I’m running it.  And it’s printing.  Enjoy the show.

<<StartTalking Player>> YES, and you’re not joking this time.

<<StartTalking Emily>> I don’t joke.

<<StartTalking Player>> I don’t know what card it was, I’m just going to buy a new ticket.

<<StartTalking Emily>> The theater is sold out, it’s a Friday Night and y’all are late to this showing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Seriously?  The previews are just starting, we aren’t that late.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Can you check again?  We aren’t that late.

<<StartTalking Emily>> If I can handle getting to the bus stop 45 minutes early for the one bus with a ramp, y’all can think to call your Dryve a whole 5 minutes earlier.  And I’ve already checked the occupancy count... twice.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Can we just try the cards?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Ok, Genius, Let’s try this again
