Jordy: And that’s how I discovered where the cold sore came from.  I have no idea how that came up?  Sorry, I talk a lot when I’m driving.

Gina: …

Player Character: …

Jordy: ...

Gina: Sooo…  5 more minutes till the theater?

Jordy: Nope, 7 minutes. I missed two turns earlier.  Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

Player Character’s Thoughts: Well this is awkward, hopefully not too awkward… Okay, probably too awkward.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Just play it cool, maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  Think about it, you haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself (delay) yet.

Player Character’s Thoughts: Is that supposed to make me feel better?

Player Character’s Anxiety: Look on the bright side, you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  This Dryve driver, Jordy, who is good at oversharing and not so good at driving..  Which is exactly why you came out on this date, to talk to the ride-share guy. 

Player Character’s Thoughts: No, this is salvageable, what do I do?

Player Character’s Dialog: No problem, the first few minutes are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

Gina: Aww, I like watching previews

Jordy: I heard they were showing a trailer for the big superhero flick before your movie.  Honestly, that trailer is probably better than what you’re seeing.  Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

Player Character’s Dialog: Critics think every movie is bad.

Jordy: Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

Gina: Great (Need a good eye roll animation), we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

Jordy: 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Gina: Why did you pick this movie again?

Player Character’s Dialog: Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?  

Jordy: And We’re Here! I hope that you are in the 30 percent of people with incorrect err… ‘unique’ opinions!  Remember to tip!

Player Character’s Dialog: Hey, I’ve got a joke!

Gina: Great!  We still have 6 minutes left to kill. 

Jordy: Probably closer to 5 (new window) Just ran that red light. (both characters get Wtf looks)

Player Character’s Dialog: Anyway… (typed out slowly) I tried to be a Dryver driver once. Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

Gina: ...

Player Character’s Dialog: ...

Jordy: Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. I love my job.
		
Gina: I think he was just making a bad joke... 

Jordy: So the gig economy is a joke?

Player Character’s Dialog: No.. yes…. How do I answer that?

Gina: From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

Player Character’s Dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it

Jordy: That’s obvious.  I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

Gina: That’s respectable.

Jordy: Plus, I’m my own boss. Nobody tells me what to do.

Player Character’s Dialog: Turn left here

(Awkward back and forth stare down between Jordy and Player)

Jordy: Get out...

Player Character’s Dialog: *Tries to unlock door*

Gina: Ummm are you trying to open the door while we’re in a moving car?

Player Character’s Dialog: No… (New window) Yes

Jordy: Dude.  Not cool.

Gina: Ok… 

<<setscene innerDate>>

Player Character’s Thoughts: Oh my god, why was that an option?

Player Character’s Anxiety: I wasn’t serious, Why did you pick that option? 

Player Character’s Thoughts: I’m an idiot.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Yeah, you are!

Player Character’s Dialog: It’s alright, Cool people don’t arrive early.

Gina: I’m less concerned about being cool than missing the beginning of the damn movie.

Player Character’s Dialog: I heard the first 20 minutes of the movie is a dream… Spoiler Warning

Gina: If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement

Player Character’s Dialog: Oops, sorry

Jordy: That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

Gina: Could you not!!!!

Jordy: … Arrives at their destination on time!  We’re here!

Player Character’s Dialog: How was your day?

Gina: Okay, could have been better.

Player Character’s Dialog: Oh ok…

Gina: …

Player Character’s Dialog: ... 

Jordy: Did something crappy happen?

Gina: Yeah Sorta, over the past few weeks my pens keep going missing.

Player Character’s Dialog: Like a pen thief?

Gina: Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

Player Character’s Dialog: That sucks, do you know who did it?

Gina: Yeah maybe, but how do you ask your coworker that?

Player Character’s Dialog: Right, that’s a struggle.

<<setscene innerDate>>

Player Character’s Thoughts: Should I give some advice.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Yeah, you’ve got experience with office supply theft.

Player Character’s Thoughts: I feel like I should say something to show that I care?

Player Character’s Dialog: That sounds rough, but I believe in your ability to handle it.

Gina: Thanks… I think I just needed someone to listen to me rant a bit

Player Character’s Dialog: Oh, Well I’m glad to help

Gina: I’ll figure out a way to handle it Monday morning

Jordy: And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!

Player Character’s Dialog: You should sneak in at night and search everyone’s desks

Gina: Yeah that sounds like…

Jordy: A terrible idea

Gina: A great idea

Player Character’s Dialog: Oh, Well I’m glad to help..

Gina: I’ll be the crazy person sneaking into my office to look through desks for my pens.

Player Character’s Dialog: Yeah, I see your point...

Gina: If the janitors or any of my late working coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice

Player Character’s Dialog: Yeah, I was mostly joking but you seem pretty set on this...

Gina: Oh, You were joking about Breaking and Entering at my place of employment to get my $10 pack of gel pens?

Jordy: You’d be justified with Gel pens.

Player Character’s Dialog: How far are we from...

Jordy: And we’re here!!!  Hope y’all enjoy the movie!
