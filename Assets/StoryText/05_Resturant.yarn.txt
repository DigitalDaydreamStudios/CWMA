<<StartTalking Player>> This place has great reviews.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great! Excuse me for a second.
<<StartTalking Gina>> I need to visit the restroom.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, ok.
<<GinaLeaves Characters>>
<<StartTalking Gina>> Back in a jif.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> She just bailed on you.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I don’t know that... It's been an okey-dokey time.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Okey-dokey…

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Are words people say...

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Let's not be one of those people.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I'm so nervous.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Well, this is a great place to nervously eat away your anxiety.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Oh, here comes the server.

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Rea>> Hey there.  Name’s Rea.
<<StartTalking Rea>> I'm here to bring you food, refill drinks and make witty banter.

<<StartTalking Player>> Nice to meet you.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Water, soft drinks or something bubly?

<<StartTalking Player>> Two waters and a bottle red wine to split with my date would be great.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Sure cap.
<<StartTalking Rea>> Want me to put an order in for an appitizer before I go?

<<StartTalking Player>> That sounds great, any recommendations?

<<StartTalking Rea>> I love the flaming shrimp.
<<StartTalking Rea>> Couldn’t have them before, because my ex was super allergic.

<<StartTalking Player>> Sucks for your ex, shrimp are delicious. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I’ll get an order of those.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Sounds good, back in a jif.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> OK, things seem to be on track again.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I'm not so sure about that.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Why..

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> 'I don't know,' he said ominously.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Sometimes things just start going well again.  
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> That doesn't mean...

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> They'll fall apart immediately after.

<<StartTalking Gina>> I need to give you heads up about something.

<<StartTalking Player>> Everything ok in the bathroom?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, but that’s not it.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I was scrolling through my feeds and noticed something...

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> Rea!

<<StartTalking Rea>> Oh hey, wait are you on a date with…

<<Silent Gina>> ...

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep, me.  
<<StartTalking Player>> Do you two know each other?

<<StartTalking Rea>> I’m gonna go cancel that order of flaming shrimp.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, I was looking forward to...
<<StartTalking Player>> ooohhh
<<StartTalking Player>> You two were

<<StartTalking Gina>> Together, but that was a few months ago.
<<StartTalking Gina>> We both past that... right?
[textPauseTime=4.0][pause]
<<StartTalking Rea>> I’m heading back to the kitchen.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Player>> Should we go?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Nah, it's ok.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> She must have gottent a new job recently.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’ll ask if we can get a new server.  She’ll understand.

<<StartTalking Player>> Or.. we could leave quickly and go somewhere else.  

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Rea>> And I’m back.  
<<StartTalking Rea>> With the wine, and no shrimp. 
<<StartTalking Rea>> So.
<<StartTalking Rea>> Ready to order?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Time to go.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Gina said that we should stay.  This’ll work out.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, I don’t see why not.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I’m sure you’re going to have a great dinner...
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> with your date's ex watching you the entire time.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> What do I do?

<<StartTalking Player>> I'm ready to order if you are, Gina. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hold on! I still need another minute.

<<StartTalking Rea>> so decisive. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Excuse me? 

<<StartTalking Rea>> Oh, Take your time.
<<StartTalking Rea>> I know you'll make up your mind before we close.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Here's a tip Rea, this isn't how you earn a tip.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Gratuity is added by default hun.
<<StartTalking Rea>> And your guy here already poured the wine.

<<StartTalking Player>> So it looks like you're both over very over this.

<<StartTalking Gina>> One of us.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Sorry that I haven't gotten over you breaking off an engagement.

<<StartTalking Player>> You two were going to get married!?

<<StartTalking Gina>> No! We only dated for a year and I am not ready for marriage. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> A year is more than enough time to know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> For some people, 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> What a normal date? 

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> It was going so well...

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> This is why restaurants serve wine.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> We can make this work.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I just need to say the right thing.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Go ahead, weigh in on whether your date made a mistake in denying their ex's marriage proposal.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I'm not sure if there is a right answer here.

<<StartTalking Player>> She has a point. A year is a long time to spend with someone in a relationship. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> See!  He feels the same way. I'll let you two have a minute. 

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> What are you doing? 

<<StartTalking Player>> I’m hungry. I told her what she wanted to hear to get her to leave. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> So you don’t actually believe that a year is too long to decide? 

<<StartTalking Player>> How am I supposed to know the answer?
<<StartTalking Player>> Honestly, this is embarressing...
<<StartTalking Player>>  I've never been in a relationship that long.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Don't be embarressed.  You have a point. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> Lucky for you it won’t take me that long to figure out what to order.

<<StartTalking Player>> If you take a year to decide what to eat then wouldn’t this date last a year, therefore, we would have been dating for a year.

<<StartTalking Gina>> You’re annoying. But in a good way.

<<StartTalking Gina>> A year isn’t enough time to decide if should spend your life with someone! 
<<StartTalking Gina>> Rom coms and reality tv has warped your perception of relationships.

<<StartTalking Rea>> My uncle Carl proposed to his wife after two weeks when he was eighteen.
<<StartTalking Rea>> They've been happily married ever since!

<<StartTalking Gina>> This is insane. I’m on a date. I don’t need this from you right now. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> You told me that you need more time to figure out if you want to be with someone forever. 
<<StartTalking Rea>> But you’re instantly dating again after we broke up. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> We broke up SIX MONTHS AGO! It's just a date. I’m not getting married.

<<StartTalking Rea>> It sounds like you don’t ever want to get married.

<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s not your concern. My life is none of your business.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> This is why I blocked you online.

<<StartTalking Rea>> You never blocked Janice.

<<StartTalking Gina>> YOU HAVE JANICE SPYING ON ME!?

<<StartTalking Rea>> No, she just logged into Facestory on my laptop last year and I’ve been using her account. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> You what!? I’m texting Janice to change her password. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> No!!!! She can’t know I was using her account. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> This is unbelievable. 
<<GinaDitches Characters>>
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m done!

<<StartTalking Player>> I’ll have the shrimp tacos, please.

<<StartTalking Player>> Gina, I think you are completely justified in believing that a year is not enough time. 
<<StartTalking Player>> My parents separated when I was a kid and I don’t want to live through that again. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Right!  Rea, could you give us a minute to decide what we want to eat.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m sure there are some other tables you’ve left waiting.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Y'all are made for each other.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> Thanks for backing me up.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> Also, I’m sorry about your parents.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s rough.

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem and you don’t have to be sorry.
<<StartTalking Player>> I’m over it... Mostly.
<<StartTalking Player>> Are you a two Christmas kid too?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Nope.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> They are happily terrible together.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> They were made to torment each other.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I feel bad for thinking this, but I almost wish they would get divorced.
<<StartTalking Gina>> So I’d be less worried about getting a phone call from one to help bury the other's body.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yikes and Yikes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Right! 

<<StartTalking Player>> But I get it.

<<StartTalking Player>> Gina, I think we should just get dinner somewhere else. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hold on, I’m not going to let an evil ex keep me from enjoying myself.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Evil Ex?

<<StartTalking Gina>> And I hope someone I just started dating would be willing to respect my feelings more than their fear of an awkward conversation.

<<StartTalking Player>> Ouch

<<StartTalking Rea>> Yikes!

<<StartTalking Gina>> I need a minute to order, it would be nice to do that without commentary, Rea.

<<StartTalking Player>> Same.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Don’t worry, I was just about to head to a less dramatic table.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> Look, I know this is a little uncomfortable...
<<StartTalking Gina>> But I need you to trust that I can take care of myself and I’m being honest when I say I’m ok.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>>  Wow, She’s guilting you for feeling concerned about her.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I wasn’t very thoughtful of her feelings... 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> But this is uncomfortable for me too.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>>  She’s too wrapped up in her feelings to even notice others.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> That's not fair.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I don’t know, maybe? 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking Player>> I'm sorry.  
<<StartTalking Player>> I guess I’m a little too wrapped up in my own nervousness that I wasn’t really thinking about what you’re going through.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh, well thank you for apologizing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Not done yet. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I get that you want to stay in this uncomfortable situation, but maybe I don’t.  
<<StartTalking Player>> And you’re ignoring that.  
<<StartTalking Player>> And that doesn't seem fair either.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hmmm...
[textPauseTime=4.0][pause]
<<StartTalking Player>> yeah...
