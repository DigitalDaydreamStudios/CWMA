<<StartTalking Player>> Here we are, this place got great reviews.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Great! I’m looking forward to it. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m heading to the bathroom.  Be right back.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh ok, see you soon.
<<GinaLeaves Characters>>
<<StartTalking Gina>> Back in a bit

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> She just bailed on you.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> We don’t know that.  We’ve had an okey-dokey time.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Let’s not use okey-dokey… ever.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Yeah, that’s probably a good call.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I am surprised she waited this long to ditch you.

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Rea>> Hey there.  Name’s Rea.
<<StartTalking Rea>> I’ll be your server.
<<StartTalking Rea>> Can I get you something to drink?

<<StartTalking Player>> Sure, can you get me a bottle of your best red and two waters?
<<StartTalking Player>> My date will be back in a second.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Sure cap, ya want an appetizer?

<<StartTalking Player>> Sounds good, any recommendations?

<<StartTalking Rea>> I love the flaming shrimp.
<<StartTalking Rea>> Couldn’t have them before, because my ex was super allergic.

<<StartTalking Player>> Good thing your ex isn’t here, because I love shrimp. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I’ll get an order of those.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Great, be back in a second.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Why do you keep saying "See you soon"

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I don't know, there is something..

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Very wrong with you.

<<GinaReturns Characters>>
<<setscene innerDateCut>>
<<setscene Restaurant>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> I need to give you heads up about something.

<<StartTalking Player>> Everything ok in the bathroom?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Yeah, but that’s not it.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I was scrolling through my apps and noticed something

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> Rea!

<<StartTalking Rea>> Oh hey, wait are you on a date with…

<<StartTalking Gina>> ....

<<StartTalking Player>> Yep, me.  
<<StartTalking Player>> Do you two know each other?

<<StartTalking Rea>> I’m gonna go cancel that order of flaming shrimp.

<<StartTalking Player>> Oh, I was looking forward to.
<<StartTalking Player>> ooohhh
<<StartTalking Player>> You two were

<<StartTalking Gina>> YUP
[textPauseTime=4.0][pause]
<<StartTalking Rea>> I’m heading back to the kitchen.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Player>> Should we go?

<<StartTalking Gina>> No, she must have gotten a new job.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> It’s ok.  I’ll ask if we can get a new server.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> She’ll understand.

<<StartTalking Player>> Let’s try and leave quickly and go somewhere else.  

<<ReaReturns Characters>>

<<StartTalking Rea>> And I’m back.  
<<StartTalking Rea>> With the wine, and no shrimp. 
<<StartTalking Rea>> So
<<StartTalking Rea>> Ready to order?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Time to go.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Gina said that we should stay.  This’ll work out.
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, I don’t see why not.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I’m sure you’re going to have a great date with an ex literally watching you the whole time.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Yeah.

<<StartTalking Player>> I am ready to order. 
<<StartTalking Player>> Gina do you want to start?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hold on! I still need another minute.

<<StartTalking Rea>> I see you’re still as indecisive as ever. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Excuse me? 
<<StartTalking Gina>> I fail to see how deciding what I want to eat and deciding if we should run off and get married are the same. 

<<StartTalking Player>> You two were going to get married!?

<<StartTalking Gina>> No! We only dated for a year and I am not ready for marriage. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> A year is more than enough time to know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> What have you gotten yourself into? 

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> A totally normal date

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah. Very normal.  A first date is a GREAT place to be discussing marriage and exes.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> We can make this work
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Go ahead, weigh in on whether your date made a mistake in denying their exes marriage proposal.

<<StartTalking Player>> She has a point. A year is a long time to spend with someone in a relationship. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> See!  He feels the same way. I will let you two have a minute. 

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> What are you doing? 

<<StartTalking Player>> I’m hungry. I told her what she wanted to hear to get her to leave. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> So you don’t actually believe that a year is too long to decide? 

<<StartTalking Player>> How am I supposed to know the answer? I have to date a girl for more than a year first. 

//Gina Laughs

<<StartTalking Gina>> You have a point. Lucky for you it won’t take me that long to figure out what to order.

<<StartTalking Player>> If you take a year to decide what to eat then wouldn’t this date last a year, therefore, we would have been dating for a year.

<<StartTalking Gina>> You’re annoying. But in a good way. So unlucky for you I know what I want.

<<StartTalking Gina>> A year isn’t enough time to decide if should spend your life with someone! 
<<StartTalking Gina>> Rom coms and reality tv has warped your perception of relationships.

<<StartTalking Rea>> My uncle Carl proposed to his wife after two weeks when he was eighteen 
<<StartTalking Rea>> and has been happily married ever since!

<<StartTalking Gina>> This is insane. I’m on a date. I don’t need this from you right now. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> Gina, you are telling me that you need more time to figure out if you want to be with someone forever. 
<<StartTalking Rea>>But you’re instantly dating again after we broke up. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> We broke up SIX MONTHS AGO! It is just a date. I’m not getting married.

<<StartTalking Rea>> It sounds like you don’t ever want to get married.

<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s not your concern. My life is none of your business.  
<<StartTalking Gina>>This is why I blocked you online.

<<StartTalking Rea>> You never blocked Janice.

<<StartTalking Gina>> YOU HAVE JANICE SPYING ON ME!?

<<StartTalking Rea>> No, she just logged into Facestory on my laptop last year and I’ve been using her account. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> You do what!? I’m texting Janice to change her password. 

<<StartTalking Rea>> No!!!! She can’t know I was using her account. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> This is unbelievable. 
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m done! 
//Gina walks out while still zoomed in on the characters face
//Camera zooms back out

<<StartTalking Player>> I’ll have the shrimp tacos, please.

<<StartTalking Player>> Gina, I think you are completely justified in believing that a year is not enough time. 
<<StartTalking Player>> My parents separated when I was a kid and I don’t want to live through that again. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Right!  Rea, could you give us a minute to decide what we want to eat.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I’m sure there are some other tables you’ve left waiting.

//These two choices then lead into the same conversation

<<StartTalking Rea>> Wow. You all are made for each other.

<<ReaLeaves Characters>>

<<StartTalking Gina>> Thanks for backing me up.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> Also, I’m sorry about your parents.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> That’s rough.

<<StartTalking Player>> No problem and you don’t have to be sorry. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I’m way past over it.  
<<StartTalking Player>> Are you a two Christmas kid too?

<<StartTalking Gina>> Nope.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> They are happily terrible together.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> They were made to torment each other.  
<<StartTalking Gina>> I feel bad for thinking this, but I almost wish they would get divorced 
<<StartTalking Gina>> so I’d be less worried about getting a call from one to help bury the other.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yikes and Yikes.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Right!

<<StartTalking Player>> Gina, I think we should just get dinner somewhere else. 

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hold on, I’m not going to let an evil ex keep me from enjoying myself.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Evil Ex?

<<StartTalking Gina>> And I hope someone I just started dating would be willing to respect my feelings more than their fear of an awkward conversation.

<<StartTalking Player>> Ouch

<<StartTalking Rea>> Yikes!

<<StartTalking Gina>> I need a minute to order, it would be nice to do that without commentary, Rea.

<<StartTalking Player>> Same.

<<StartTalking Rea>> Don’t worry, I was just about to head to a less dramatic table.

//TODO: Remove Rea from Scene leaves

<<StartTalking Gina>> Look, I know this is a little uncomfortable...
<<StartTalking Gina>> But I need you to trust that I can take care of myself and I’m being honest when I say I’m ok.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>>  Wow, She’s guilting you for feeling concerned about her.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>>  I wasn’t being very thoughtful, but this is uncomfortable for me too.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>>  She’s too wrapped up in her feelings to even notice others.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>>  I don’t know, maybe? 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<StartTalking Player>> I'm sorry.  
<<StartTalking Player>> I guess I’m a little too wrapped up in my own nervousness that I wasn’t really thinking about what you’re going through.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Oh, well thank you for apologizing.

<<StartTalking Player>> Not done yet. 
<<StartTalking Player>> I get that you want to stay in this uncomfortable situation, but maybe I don’t.  
<<StartTalking Player>> And you’re ignoring that.  
<<StartTalking Player>> And that doesn't seem fair either.

<<StartTalking Gina>> Hmmm...
[textPauseTime=4.0][pause]
<<StartTalking Player>> yeah...
