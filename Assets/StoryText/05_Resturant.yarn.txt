<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Here we are, this place got great reviews.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Great! I’m looking forward to it. 
I’m heading to the bathroom.  Be right back.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh ok, see you soon.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Back in a bit

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> She just bailed on you.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> We don’t know that.  We’ve had an okey-dokey time.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Let’s not use okey-dokey… ever.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Yeah, that’s probably a good call.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> I am surprised she waited this long to ditch you. 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Hey there.  Name’s Rea.
I’ll be your server.
Can I get you something to drink?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Sure, can you get me a bottle of your best red and two waters?
My date will be back in a second.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Sure cap, ya want an appetizer?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Sounds good, any recommendations?

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> I love the flaming shrimp.
Couldn’t have them before, because my ex was super allergic.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Good thing your ex isn’t here, because I love shrimp. 
I’ll get an order of those.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Great, be back in a second.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> See you soon.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Why do you keep saying "See you soon"

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> I don't know, there is something..

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Very wrong with you.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>
<<setscene Restaurant>>

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I need to give you heads up about something.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Everything ok in the bathroom?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Yeah, but that’s not it.  
I was scrolling through my apps and noticed something...
(Rea appears) 
Rea!

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Oh hey, wait are you on a date with…

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> ....

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Yep, me.  Do you two know each other?

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> I’m gonna go cancel that order of flaming shrimp.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Oh, I was looking forward to
...ooohhh wait.  
You two were..

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> YUP...
(Pause)
<<set $speaker to "Rea">> ...I’m heading back to the kitchen.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Should we go?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> No, she must have gotten a new job.  
It’s ok.  I’ll ask if we can get a new server.  
She’ll understand.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Let’s try and leave quickly and go somewhere else.  
(Said as Rea slides back in)

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> And I’m back.  
With the wine, and no shrimp. 
So...Ready to order?

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Time to go.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Gina said that we should stay.  This’ll work out.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Yeah, I don’t see why not.  
I’m sure you’re going to have a great date with an ex literally watching you the whole time.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> Yeah..

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I am ready to order. 
Gina do you want to start?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Hold on! I still need another minute.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> I see you’re still as indecisive as ever. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Excuse me? 
I fail to see how deciding what I want to eat and deciding if we should run off and get married are the same. 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> You two were going to get married!?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> No! We only dated for a year and I am not ready for marriage. 

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> A year is more than enough time to know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>
<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> What have you gotten yourself into? 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> A totally normal date…

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Yeah. Very normal.  A first date is a GREAT place to be discussing marriage and exes.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character's Thoughts">> We can make this work.. 
I think.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Go ahead, weigh in on whether your date made a mistake in denying their exes marriage proposal.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> She has a point. A year is a long time to spend with someone in a relationship. 

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> See!  He feels the same way. I will let you two have a minute. 

(Rea walks off)

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> What are you doing? 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I’m hungry. I told her what she wanted to hear to get her to leave. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> So you don’t actually believe that a year is too long to decide? 

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> How am I supposed to know the answer? I have to date a girl for more than a year first. 

(Gina laughs)

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> You have a point. Lucky for you it won’t take me that long to figure out what to order.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> If you take a year to decide what to eat then wouldn’t this date last a year, therefore, we would have been dating for a year.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> You’re annoying. But in a good way. So unlucky for you I know what I want.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> A year isn’t enough time to decide if should spend your life with someone! Rom coms and reality tv has warped your perception of relationships.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> My uncle Carl proposed to his wife after two weeks when he was eighteen and has been happily married ever since!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> This is insane. I’m on a date. I don’t need this from you right now. 

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Gina, you are telling me that you need more time to figure out if you want to be with someone forever. But you’re instantly dating again after we broke up. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> We broke up SIX MONTHS AGO! It is just a date. I’m not getting married.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> It sounds like you don’t ever want to get married.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> That’s not your concern. My life is none of your business.  This is why I blocked you online.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> You never blocked Janice.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> YOU HAVE JANICE SPYING ON ME!?

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> No, she just logged into Facestory on my laptop last year and I’ve been using her account. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> You do what!? I’m texting Janice to change her password. 

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> No!!!! She can’t know I was using her account. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> This is unbelievable. I’m done! (Gina walks out while still zoomed in on the characters face)
(Camera zooms back out)

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I’ll have the shrimp tacos, please.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Gina, I think you are completely justified in believing that a year is not enough time. My parents separated when I was a kid and I don’t want to live through that again. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Right!  Rea, could you give us a minute to decide what we want to eat.  I’m sure there are some other tables you’ve left waiting.

(These two choices then lead into the same conversation)

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Wow. You all are made for each other.  (Walks away)

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Thanks for backing me up.  Also, I’m sorry about your parents.  That’s rough.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> No problem and you don’t have to be sorry.  I’m way past over it.  Are you a two Christmas kid too?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Nope.  They are happily terrible together.  They were made to torment each other.  I feel bad for thinking this, but I almost wish they would get divorced so I’d be less worried about getting a call from one to help bury the other.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Yikes and Yikes.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Right!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Gina, I think we should just get dinner somewhere else. 

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Hold on, I’m not going to let an evil ex keep me from enjoying myself.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Evil Ex?

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> And I hope someone I just started dating would be willing to respect my feelings more than their fear of an awkward conversation.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Ouch

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Yikes!

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> I need a minute to order, it would be nice to do that without commentary, Rea.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Same.

<<set $speaker to "Rea">> Don’t worry, I was just about to head to a less dramatic table.

//TODO: Remove Rea from Scene leaves

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Look, I know this is a little uncomfortable...
But I need you to trust that I can take care of myself and I’m being honest when I say I’m ok.

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">>  Wow, She’s guilting you for feeling concerned about her.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">>  I wasn’t being very thoughtful, but this is uncomfortable for me too.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">>  She’s too wrapped up in her feelings to even notice others.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">>  I don’t know, maybe? 

<<setscene innerDateCut>>

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> I'm sorry.  
I guess I’m a little too wrapped up in my own nervousness that I wasn’t really thinking about what you’re going through.

<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Oh, well thank you for apologizing.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> Not done yet. 
I get that you want to stay in this uncomfortable situation, but maybe I don’t.  
And you’re ignoring that.  
And that doesn't seem fair either.
//TODO: Add a Pause
<<set $speaker to "Gina">> Hmmm...
(Pause)
<<set $speaker to "Player Character">> yeah...
