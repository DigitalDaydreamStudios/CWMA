Jordy: And that’s how I discovered where the cold sore came from.  
I have no idea how that came up.  
Sorry, I talk a lot when I’m driving.

Gina: …

Gordo: …

Jordy: ...

Gina: Sooo…  5 more minutes till the theater?

Jordy: Nope, 7 minutes. I missed two turns earlier.  Sorry.

Gordo: Well this is awkward, hopefully not too awkward… Okay, probably too awkward.

Gordo’s Anxiety: Just play it cool, maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  Think about it, you haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself (delay) yet.

Gordo’s Thoughts: Is that supposed to make me feel better?

Gordo’s Anxiety: Look on the bright side, you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  This Dryve driver, Jordy, who is good at oversharing and not so good at driving..  Which is exactly why you came out on this date, to talk to the rideshare guy. 

Gordo’s Thoughts: No, this is salvageable, what do I do?
