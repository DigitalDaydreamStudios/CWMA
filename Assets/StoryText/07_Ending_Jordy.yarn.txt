<<StartTalking Jordy>> So I take it that didn’t work out

<<StartTalking Player>> Of course not.  We weren’t compatible.  Or I wasn’t ready.  Or I wasn’t worth it.  I don’t know.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> Well which one is it?

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I’ll tell you, that’s all crap you’re telling yourself.  
<<StartTalking Jordy>> You were nice to the rideshare guy while simultaneously trying to have a date yourself.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, but didn’t get a second date…

<<StartTalking Jordy>> But you will.  You will get a second date with someone.. eventually.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks, I needed to hear that.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> I can tell you’re a nice guy just having a bad night.

<<StartTalking Player>> I think I could use some time to spend on myself before I try this again.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> That's probably a good strategy, but no one is perfect...
<<StartTalking Jordy>> except maybe The Rock.
<<StartTalking Jordy>> If you wait till you are, you're going to be single forever...
<<StartTalking Jordy>> excluding The Rock.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks, *laughs* I needed that, Not sure if I can become The Rock.

<<StartTalking Jordy>> And that's ok! Everyone settles for who they are right now. 
<<StartTalking Jordy>> Life's an work in progress, like driving without missing all my turns.

<<StartTalking Player>> That makes sense.  
<<StartTalking Player>> But I probably need more time to work on myself before I try this whole thing again.
