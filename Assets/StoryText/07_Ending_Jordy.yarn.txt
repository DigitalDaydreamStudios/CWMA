<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> So I take it that didn’t work out

<<StartTalking Player>> Of course not.  We weren’t compatible.  Or I wasn’t ready.  Or I wasn’t worth it.  I don’t know.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> Well which one is it?

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> I’ll tell you, that’s all crap you’re telling yourself.  You were nice to the rideshare guy while simultaneously trying to have a date yourself.

<<StartTalking Player>> Yeah, but didn’t get a second date…

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> But you will.  You will get a second date with someone.. eventually.

<<StartTalking Player>> Thanks, I needed to hear that.

<<set $speaker to "Jordy">> I can tell you’re a nice guy, you just had a bad night.

<<StartTalking Player>> I think I could use some time to spend on myself before I try this again.
