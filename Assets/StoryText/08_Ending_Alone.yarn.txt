<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Great job.  You nailed it!

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Shut up.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You found a way to fail out of this date too.  How many has it been?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Too many, I’m well aware.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> I toast to many more.  At least you’ve got me.  Always there to remind you how much of a stud you are.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think that’s the problem.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> What?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I was more focused on how nervous I was than how nervous they were.  They were probably dealing with the same thing. I was too caught up in my own anxiety to focus on having a good date.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, but not as much as a failure as you…

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Maybe, Maybe Not.  I don’t know that, and you don’t either.  

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> But you know you failed.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> But what’s succeeding?  I think going on a bad date might mean I just avoided a bad relationship.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Relationship??? When was the last time you went on a second date?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I need confidence.  And I won’t have any confidence if I stay in this toxic relationship with you.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Here’s the truth.  You wouldn’t date yourself.  You’ve spent this entire night arguing with and ridiculing yourself.  No one would find that appealing.  Until you make peace with that, you’re going to be single.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Maybe, maybe not.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Whether you think it’s true, or you think it’s a lie - you’re right.
