<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Great job.  You nailed it!

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> Shut up.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> You found a way to fail out of this date too.  How many has it been?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> Too many, I’m well aware.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> I toast to many more.  At least you’ve got me.  Always there to remind you how much of a stud you are.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> I think that’s the problem.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> What?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> I was more focused on how nervous I was than how nervous they were.  They were probably dealing with the same thing. I was too caught up in my own anxiety to focus on having a good date.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Yeah, but not as much as a failure as you…

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> Maybe, Maybe Not.  I don’t know that, and you don’t either.  

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> But you know you failed.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> But what’s succeeding?  I think going on a bad date might mean I just avoided a bad relationship.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Relationship??? When was the last time you went on a second date?

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> I need confidence.  And I won’t have any confidence if I stay in this toxic relationship with you.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Here’s the truth.  You wouldn’t date yourself.  You’ve spent this entire night arguing with and ridiculing yourself.  No one would find that appealing.  Until you make peace with that, you’re going to be single.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Thoughts">> Maybe, maybe not.

<<set $speaker to "Player Character’s Anxiety">> Whether you think it’s true, or you think it’s a lie - you’re right.
