<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Great job.  You nailed it!

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Shut up.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You found a way to fail out of this date too.  How many has it been?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Too many.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> A toast to many more.  At least you’ve got me.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Always there to remind you how much of a stud you are.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I think that’s the problem.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> What?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I was so focused on my nervousness, I ignored my date's feelings.  
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> They were probably dealing with the same thing. 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I was too caught up in my own anxiety to enjoy the night.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Or, they could have been well adjusted and normal.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Maybe, Maybe Not. 

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> But you know you failed.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> And what’s succeeding? 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Going on a bad date might mean I just avoided a bad relationship.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Relationship??? When was the last time you went on a second date?

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I need confidence. And I won’t have any confidence if I stay in this toxic relationship with you.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Everyone's got anxiety...

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> But not this much.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Here’s the truth. You wouldn’t date yourself.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You’ve spent this entire night arguing with and ridiculing yourself.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> No one would find that appealing.  
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Until you make peace with that, you’re going to be single.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Maybe, maybe not.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Hedging again!
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You're not going to handle any of this better if you can't commit.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Maybe, I'm not sure I'm ready for that..

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> MAYBE, you shouldn't be dating til you figure that out.
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> MAYBE, you wouldn't have failed so hard if you knew what you wanted.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I hear you. 

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Yeah, but you're not listening. It's time to start
 
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Listening?  I've been doing that.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> It's time to start coping.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> So this weekend is dedicated to binging some tv, playing video games and relaxing.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Sounds productive..

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I'm not productive now, with all this pressure, fear and self-doubt.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> I'm not on a deadline, this bad date isn't the end of the world.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> And I won't have a nervous breakdown because of this.

<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> Self-care, sounds like something off a magazine in the grocery checkout line.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Cute, but it's hard to be anxious when I'm not stressed.
<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> And there will still be people to date once I'm not a mess.

<<Silent PlayersAnxiety>> ...
<<Silent PlayersAnxiety>> ...

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Quiet.

<<Silent PlayersAnxiety>> ...
<<StartTalking PlayersAnxiety>> You'll screw this up eventually.

<<StartTalking PlayersBrain>> Probably, but eventually isn't something I have to worry about right now.
