Jordy: ...

Gina: Sooo…  5 more minutes till the theater?

Jordy: Nope, 7 minutes. I missed two turns earlier.  Sorry.

<<setscene innerDate>>

Player Character’s Thoughts: Well this is awkward, hopefully not too awkward… Okay, probably too awkward.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Just play it cool, maybe they won’t notice how much of a mess you are.  Think about it, you haven’t had the chance to embarrass yourself (delay) yet.

Player Character’s Thoughts: Is that supposed to make me feel better?

Player Character’s Anxiety: Look on the bright side, you’ve made a wonderful new friend.  This Dryve driver, Jordy, who is good at oversharing and not so good at driving..  Which is exactly why you came out on this date, to talk to the ride-share guy. 

Player Character’s Thoughts: No, this is salvageable, what do I do?

Player Character’s Dialog: No problem, the first few minutes are previews anyway.  Let it Ride.

Gina: Aww, I like watching previews

Jordy: I heard they were showing a trailer for the big superhero flick before your movie.  Honestly, that trailer is probably better than what you’re seeing.  Rotten Potatoes says this movie is certified trash.

Player Character’s Dialog: Critics think every movie is bad.

Jordy: Nah dude. It was in the 30s for Critics AND User Reviews.

Gina: Great (Need a good eye roll animation), we’re about to sit through a 2 hour bomb.

Jordy: 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Gina: Why did you pick this movie again?

Player Character’s Dialog: Maybe it will be so bad it’s good?

Player Character’s Dialog: Anyway… (typed out slowly) I tried to be a Dryver driver once. Trouble is, my passengers didn’t appreciate when I went the extra mile. 

Gina: ...

Player Character’s Dialog: ...

Jordy: Hey man, I don’t like when you make fun of my job. I love my job.
		
Gina: I think he was just making a bad joke... 

Jordy: So the gig economy is a joke?

Player Character’s Dialog: No.. yes…. How do I answer that?

Gina: From a labor perspective it exploits workers while concentrating capital towards the top.

Player Character’s Dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it

Jordy: That’s obvious.  I mean you’re not wrong, but when you work 9 to 5, just $2 above minimum wage, you’ve got to be creative to make a legal living.  

Gina: That’s respectable.

Jordy: Plus, I’m my own boss. Nobody tells me what to do.

Gina: If you say ‘Spoiler Warning’ after the spoiler, it isn’t really a warning. It’s a Spoiler Announcement

Player Character’s Dialog: Oops, sorry

Jordy: That’s a good point, I’m going to start using that when I spoil things accidentally.  Spoiler Announcement!  At the end of the movie the main character…

Gina: Yup, full scale office supply larceny.  It wouldn’t be a big deal if I hadn’t went and purchased my own pens.

Gina: I’ll be the crazy person sneaking into my office to look through desks for my pens.

Gina: If the janitors or any of my late working coworkers are there, I’ll just explain how I was wronged and deserve pen justice

Gina: Maybe we could have a second first date in a week?

Player Character’s Dialog: That might be a good idea, and there's less pressure.

Gina: Yeah, It couldn't get much worse.

Jordy: So I take it that didn’t work out

Player Character’s Dialog: Of course not.  We weren’t compatible.  Or I wasn’t ready.  Or I wasn’t worth it.  I don’t know.

Jordy: Well which one is it?

Jordy: I’ll tell you, that’s all crap you’re telling yourself.  You were nice to the rideshare guy while simultaneously trying to have a date yourself.

Player Character’s Dialog: Yeah, but didn’t get a second date…

Jordy: But you will.  You will get a second date with someone.. eventually.

Player Character’s Dialog: Thanks, I needed to hear that.

Jordy: I can tell you’re a nice guy, you just had a bad night.

Player Character’s Dialog: I think I could use some time to spend on myself before I try this again.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Great job.  You nailed it!

Player Character’s Thoughts: Shut up.

Player Character’s Anxiety: You found a way to fail out of this date too.  How many has it been?

Player Character’s Thoughts: Too many, I’m well aware.

Player Character’s Anxiety: I toast to many more.  At least you’ve got me.  Always there to remind you how much of a stud you are.

Player Character’s Thoughts: I think that’s the problem.

Player Character’s Anxiety: What?

Player Character’s Thoughts: I was more focused on how nervous I was than how nervous they were.  They were probably dealing with the same thing. I was too caught up in my own anxiety to focus on having a good date.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Yeah, but not as much as a failure as you…

Player Character’s Thoughts: Maybe, Maybe Not.  I don’t know that, and you don’t either.  

Player Character’s Anxiety: But you know you failed.

Player Character’s Thoughts: But what’s succeeding?  I think going on a bad date might mean I just avoided a bad relationship.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Relationship??? When was the last time you went on a second date?

Player Character’s Thoughts: I need confidence.  And I won’t have any confidence if I stay in this toxic relationship with you.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Here’s the truth.  You wouldn’t date yourself.  You’ve spent this entire night arguing with and ridiculing yourself.  No one would find that appealing.  Until you make peace with that, you’re going to be single.

Player Character’s Thoughts: Maybe, maybe not.

Player Character’s Anxiety: Whether you think it’s true, or you think it’s a lie - you’re right.
